####v2.09a

^<20161112>

* **Sea and Sky now summons normal rain instead of heavy rain.**
* **Speedrunner no longer has the Technician effect.**
* *Bug Fix: Z-Sash now activates its recovery effect when the holder survives from a lethal hit.*
* *Lass zeowx now has 341 speed to surpass the crowded 339 speed tier.*
* *MasterLeoZangetsu's HP is now a multiple of 4 to make better use of his moveset/item.*
* *Whatevs4's HP is now NOT a multiple of 4.*
* *NoFunMantis and MegaCharizard now has odd HP.*
* *Natsugan's stats are optimized.*
* *Hunting of Proctors' BP increased to 65 from 60.*
* Even more quotes.

* **Known Bugs:**
 * Ganon's Sword's temporary stat boost still happening even when the opposing Pokemon has the No Fun Allowed ability.
 * Pokemon at full health with Sturdy or Focus Sash cannot die from Mine, same for Focus Band/Beat Misty if it triggers.
 * [<Pokemon>'s Speedrunner!] is shown twice when a Pokemon with the ability is switched in.
 * Spoopify doesn't remove added types (this is correct), but the client doesn't show the added types after the types are changed.

     For example, Coryn216 becomes Water/Ice+Dragon after Slick Ice, and Spoopify changes it to Ghost/Ice+Dragon. The client only shows that it's Ghost/Ice type.

####v2.09

^<20161111>

* *TM56 and Hex Attack now target an adjacent Pokemon.*

####v2.08a

^<20161029>

* **New Item: Goat of Arms. Some Goats now has that instead of Rocket Hooves.**
* *Bug Fix: Coryn's ability now works as it should.*
* Goat Flu and Goat of Arms now have proper tags in the client thanks to some mumbo jumbo I did with new status tag things.
* Minor quote additions.

----

####v2.08

^<20161027>

* **New Pokemon: Coryn216! With new ability Slick Ice, and new move Absolute Zero!**
* *Re-Roll will now allow Natsugan to instantly Primal Evolve upon gaining a Red or Blue Orb. Previously Primal Evolution only happened on switch-in.*

----

####v2.07

^<20161026>

* **New Pokemon: Some Goats, for STPPLB+.**
* *Rapid Spin and Defog can remove Mines now.*
* *Quick Sketch, Mimic, and standard Sketch can now no longer copy the explosion result of Set Mine.*

----

####v2.06a

^<20161025>

* *Set Mine can now be cleared by Rapid Spin and Defog.*
* *War Echo won't crash the battle anymore. Not that it did, IIRC.*
* In-battle quotes from the Pokemon no longer spoil move selection or outcome (they're not instantly added anymore, like normal chat messages). Normal chat messages are unaffected.
* Separated out quotes from their moves, so now different Pokemon can say different things. For example, Lorewriter Cole's Text to Speech move will still have him say "I shall smite thee with potatoes of doom! WHEEEEEE", but someone else using the move may repeat the phrase "walnut" or "potato" 20 times instead.
* Pokemon may now say a different quote when sent out in battle for the first time than when sent out subsequent times.
* The client now allows for a custom message hack for starting and ending custom side conditions. Set Mine now uses it to say something more compelling than "Set Mine Started!". I may use this technique in the future for other types of messages.
* Swahahahahaggers now presents itself on switch in, instead of mysteriously causing seemingly random confusion.

----

####v2.06

* ***Testing: Developers now only need to make a team with a name that matches (exactly) an existing mon. That mon will be replaced with the full mon (including moves, abilities, etc) upon starting the battle. For example, an Unown with the name "Natsugan", with no moves assigned, will turn into Natsugan the Flygon, with random Mega Stone in hand, Re-Roll, and other moves.***
* ***Internal refactoring, allowing us to not have to define a Pokemon three times for each of the three formats, among other things.***
* *Due to above, Natsugan now has a consistent EV set (previously, it differed by 4 HP EVs).*
* *Bug Fix: Assassinate now actually hits after using Lock 'n' Load (or any other Lock-On-like move).*
* *Bug Fix: HazorEx no longer Trace's an opponent upon Mega Evolution. (And other bugs might also be fixed due to this streamlining of Mega abilities.)*
* *Bug Fix: Re-Roll should no longer be able to select Re-Roll as a move. It should also allow Mega Evolution for Pokemon that did not start the battle with a Mega Stone.*
* *Bug Fix: Clients should now see the proper abilities of Mega-Evolved mon (ignore the "base" ability thing).*
* Some move descriptions were updated / created. There are still 22 moves without descriptions.
* Added the ability to have multiple quotes for switching in/fainting. Currently only two of Mantis's Pokemon use this to say "GGioz" or "GGCtrl27" at random when fainting. There are still 17 Pokemon without switch in/faint quotes.
* Minor text fixes.

* **Known Bug:** Upon using Re-Roll, the user does not automatically Primal Revert if it receives an orb.

----

####v2.05

* **Updated Mix and Mega code. It may or may not work.**
* *Bug Fix: Pokson and Lyca now reliably retain their abilities upon Mega.*

----

####v2.04

* ***Speedy Pokson is removed from STPPLB format due to the addition of Pokson.***
* **New Pokemon: Pokson! He focuses on Water moves and can cripple his opponent's Special Attack while doing damage (if lucky)!**
* **New Pokemon: Cerebral_Harlot! He has a unique ability that forces his opponent out with just a switch-in, and possesses a powerful nuke!**
* **Speedy Pokson is now a Deoxys-Speed with an improved moveset. He now has a way to remove entry hazards!**
* **Soma Ghost now has a wider movepool, an Eviolite, and has changed his nature.**
* *TieSoul now has a consistent moveset in all 3 formats.*
* *Bug fix: Soma Ghost crashing the server when switched in.*

* **Swahahahahagers reworked - it now always confuses for 1 turn, with 70% self-hit chance.**
* **Quick Sketch reworked - The sketched move is now added to the existing moveset rather than replacing the second move, up to a maximum of 8 moves. Otherwise, it will replace a random move within the first 8 moves the user has.**

* *Ban Evade now raises Evasion to 0 if a Pokemon with the ability has lower than 0 Evasion at turn end with higher than 50% of max HP.*
* *Ban Evade now does NOT raise Evasion to 1 between 50% and 75% of max HP.*
